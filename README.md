### What is BATA (BTA)?


The predecessor of barter trade dollars. Soon to release new POW/POS Hybrid.

Bata (BTA) is a currency that has been developed to replace trade dollars in traditional Barter Systems. As the "Sharing Economy" grows, so does the decentralized market.

Bata aims to change way the way we trade, by introducing Barter on the Blockchain.

A Barter Currency has been re-invented on a blockchain, decentralized, secure and widely available in the form of BTA, replacing a Trade Dollar. Trade Dollars are just like cash and for that matter are based on regular currency, but in current Barter Systems they are controlled and issued by a central party.

BTA is traded on multiple cryptocurrency exchanges right across the globe.

### instructions for Linux compile: 

sudo apt-get install git build-essential openssl libminiupnpc-dev libboost++-dev libboost-all-dev libssl-dev libdb++-dev automake qt4-dev-tools libtool libqt4-dev libprotobuf-dev qrencode
git clone https://github.com/BTA-BATA/BATA-SOURCE
cd BATA-SOURCE
sudo chmod +777 *
./autogen.sh
./configure
make

(it will instruct you to make a bata.conf file, so make the bata.conf file and place in the .bata/ folder.)

### example regular internet users' bata.conf:

rpcuser=BATAusername

rpcpassword=BATAuserpass

### example for i2P users' BATA.conf:
(you will need to download the latest i2p software)
https://geti2p.net/en/download

rpcuser=BATAusername

rpcpassword=BATAuserpass

i2p=1

proxy=127.0.0.1:3643

connect=lv4llpu75ydlfwxgx3ej5t6dpcnyi47px4wnluf7pyxpncd5trca.b32.i2p

### example for tor users' bata.conf:
(you will need to download tor software)
https://www.torproject.org/download/

rpcuser=BATAusername

rpcpassword=BATAuserpass

tor=1

proxy=127.0.0.1:9050

connect=eoekwl6m56nus2a7.onion

### possible errors during compile:

virtual memory exhausted: Cannot allocate memory

make: *** [obj/bitcoinrpc.o] Error 1

here, we just need to set up a swap file, because we ran out of memory:

sudo fallocate -l 4G /swapfile

sudo chmod 600 /swapfile

sudo mkswap /swapfile

sudo swapon /swapfile

### Make the Swap File Permanent

We have our swap file enabled, but when we reboot, the server will not automatically enable the file. We can change that though by modifying the fstab file.

Edit the file with root privileges in your text editor:

sudo nano /etc/fstab

At the bottom of the file, you need to add a line that will tell the operating system to automatically use the file you created:

/swapfile   none    swap    sw    0   0

Save and close the file when you are finished.

Development process
-------------------

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think
their feature or bug fix is ready.

If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the Bata
development team members simply pulls it.

If it is a *more complicated or potentially controversial* change, then the patch
submitter will be asked to start a discussion (if they haven't already) on the
[mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bata-dev).

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing.
Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if the code doesn't
match the project's coding conventions (see [doc/coding.md](doc/coding.md)) or are
controversial.

The `master-0.10` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/bata-project/bata/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Bata.

Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing
other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Large changes should have a test plan, and should be tested by somebody other
than the developer who wrote the code.
Creating a thread in the [Bata discussion forum](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1040956.0) will allow the Bata
development team members to review your proposal and to provide assistance with creating a test plan. 


Translations
------------

**Important**: We do not accept translation changes as GitHub pull requests because the next
pull from Transifex would automatically overwrite them again.

We only accept translation fixes that are submitted through [Bitcoin Core's Transifex page](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/bitcoin/).
Translations are converted to Bata periodically.

Development tips and tricks
---------------------------

**compiling for debugging**

Run configure with the --enable-debug option, then make. Or run configure with
CXXFLAGS="-g -ggdb -O0" or whatever debug flags you need.

**debug.log**

If the code is behaving strangely, take a look in the debug.log file in the data directory;
error and debugging messages are written there.

The -debug=... command-line option controls debugging; running with just -debug will turn
on all categories (and give you a very large debug.log file).

The Qt code routes qDebug() output to debug.log under category "qt": run with -debug=qt
to see it.

**testnet and regtest modes**

Run with the -testnet option to run with "play batas" on the test network, if you
are testing multi-machine code that needs to operate across the internet.

If you are testing something that can run on one machine, run with the -regtest option.
In regression test mode, blocks can be created on-demand; see qa/rpc-tests/ for tests
that run in -regtest mode.

**DEBUG_LOCKORDER**

Bata Core is a multithreaded application, and deadlocks or other multithreading bugs
can be very difficult to track down. Compiling with -DDEBUG_LOCKORDER (configure
CXXFLAGS="-DDEBUG_LOCKORDER -g") inserts run-time checks to keep track of which locks
are held, and adds warnings to the debug.log file if inconsistencies are detected.
